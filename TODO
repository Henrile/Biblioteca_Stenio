1) Implement a Point in Polygon in O(lg n) following the fast geometry lib model.
   Problem: https://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/110/p11072.pdf

2) Implement a good version of closest pair of points.
   It also has to follow the stanford model.

3) Add a Linear Algebra section.
   * Determinant
   * Rank of a matrix
   * Invert a Matrix
   * Gaussian Elimination

4) With a linear algebra section, becomes easy to add stuff like:
   * Counting the numberof spanning trees in a graph.
